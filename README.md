#created an ExpressJS app that accomplishes the following:
  #Connected to the Github API
  #Get the nodejs/node repository
  #Get the most recent commits (choose at least 25 or more of the commits)
  #Created a route that displays the recent commits by author.
  #If the commit hash ends in a number, color that row to yellow (#FFFF00).
